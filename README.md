ok yk when ur vibing in the woods riding ur bike ye but its -10 deg C and a song ur not in the mood comes on, ANNOYINNNNNNN, why?
bc u have to:
a) suffer thru da song (mental pain)
b) suffer thru da cold (physical pain, nc u gotta take ur glove off to interact wif ur phone or headphone, since they be using captive stuff now)
so using a nrf52840 for £1.20 and this code (idk how much u pay ur isp, lets say £10). for only 50 (inc. cheapest soldering iron, and all that extra stuff)
you can have a super neat thing to skip songs by jus pressing a button on ur bike!

i prolly wont make a 3d model or any instructions bc its only one part of the project, the main thing is a bike speedometer using a e-paper display!
(unless this gets 5 stars i will...)
